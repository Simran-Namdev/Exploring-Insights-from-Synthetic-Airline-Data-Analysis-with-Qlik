## Dashboard

Two interactive dashboards were developed in Qlik to provide a comprehensive overview of the airline data. These dashboards allow users to explore and analyze the data from different perspectives, enabling informed decision-making.

## Story

A data story was created to present the analysis and findings in a narrative format, making the information more engaging and easier to understand. The story includes an introduction, a body presenting the data and analysis, and a conclusion summarizing the key findings and their implications.
